Section 1. Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
This project entailed filtering and using data on a media campaign in various countries. The data are from the same year and provide information on type of medium, goal, pledge, date, and location, etc. The task at hand was to filter the data to a subcategory (theater) and analysis the outcomes variable via two explanatory variables dates and goal. The goal of the analysis was to identify trends through goals and date in terms of successful, failed, and canceled theater campaigns.
Section 2. Analysis and Challenges: 
The outcomes based on launch date sheet and chart was created by pivot table pulling data from the Kickstarter data sheet. Data was filtered to display a count of outcomes on the Y axis and months on the x axis. No difficulties were encountered with the creation of this chart. 
The Outcomes Based on Goal chart used data from the Kickstarter data sheet. Data was organized by goal size primarily via $5,000 intervals. Totals were summed and percentages calculated for each outcome classification according to their respective $ interval. The primary difficultly is ensuring the totals accurately represent the totals for each group while building out the intervals.  
Section 3 Results:
The two conclusion one can draw about the Theater Outcome by launch data are i. there were more successful campaigns than any other outcome and ii. that the most successful months were during the summer. Success and Fail outcomes have an inverse relationship especially where most of the data falls which is below the $25,000 threshold. Meaning the higher the goal the more likely it was to fail. Data on the higher end of the of the x-axis is limited to much fewer observations and has a higher variance. The data could also be present in a pie chart with the total broken out by outcome.
